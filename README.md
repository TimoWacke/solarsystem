### This is our CiS-Project ###

- Define your objects in ParticleFactory.py
- Pass a simulation class to create an Animation with Animate.py
- Show Graphs and Animations in Execute.py
- Physical laws are implemented in Particle.py
- in the Simulate class you find a verlet algorithm implemented

### Quickstart ###
Use the prepared Execute.py file to create first animations,
or go step by step through the Guide.ipynb Notebook



To save videos created in Animate.py you might need an ffmpeg.exe file inside the main folder.
